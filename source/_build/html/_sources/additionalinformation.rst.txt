Changelog
====================

Giotto 1.0.1 - 1.0.3
-----------------------

-  Fixed bugs
-  Added seed to HMRF
-  Created functions to read 10X Visium .h5 files

   -  see **createGiottoVisiumObject** to create a Giotto object
      directly

Giotto 1.0.0
-----------------------

This is the first major release of Giotto. If you still want to work
with the previous version, then you can find the older releases
`here <https://github.com/RubD/Giotto/tags>`__.

Here is an overview about what has changed in the meantime:

-  **NEW:** Addition of **getSpatialDataset** to directly download a spatial dataset (expression matrix, spatial coordinates and metadata). This is now also included in the examples that you can find under the **Datasets** tab on this website.

-  **NEW:** We have added tools to install, remove and check a Giotto
   r-miniconda environment. This miniconda environment is one way to
   make sure that you can run functions that require Python modules.
   
   - **installGiottoEnvironment**: (re-)installs a Giotto miniconda environment
   - **removeGiottoEnvironment**: removes a Giotto miniconda environment
   - **checkGiottoEnvironment**: verifies if a Giotto environment can be found


The other alternative is to
`install <https://rubd.github.io/Giotto_site/articles/installation_issues.html#python-manual-installation>`__
them in your own favorite Python environment and provide the path in the
**createGiottoInstructions** command.

-  Extension and improvement of spatial gene detection methods:

   -  **NEW:** addition of **spark** method
   -  Improvements for silhouetteRank:

      -  Faster implementation
      -  Multi parameter version as **silhouetteRankTest**

   -  Improvements for binSpect:

      -  Faster implementation
      -  Multi parameter version: **binSpectSingle** or **binSpectMulti**

-  Spatial cell type enrichment methods have been streamlined and
   updated

   -  **runPAGEEnrich** to run enrichment using PAGE algorithm and selected marker genes
   -  **runRankEnrich** to run enrichment using a whole expression matrix
   -  **runHyperGeometricEnrich** to run enrichment using the hypergeometric test

-  **NEW:** Spatial cell type deconvolution has been added:

   -  use **runSpatialDeconv** or **runDWLSDeconv**

-  **NEW:** Addition of **addCellIntMetadata** to add information about
   interacting cell types, which can subsequently be viewed with the
   spatPlot commands.

-  **NEW:** Addition of 3 small vignettes that cover different types of
   spatial datasets:

   -  single-cell resolution (`mini
      seqFISH+ <../articles/mini_seqfish.html>`__)
   -  multi-cell resolution (`mini
      visium <../articles/mini_visium.html>`__)
   -  3D dataset (`mini STARmap <../articles/mini_starmap.html>`__)
   -  See **data(package = ‘Giotto’)**

-  Cell Proximity Genes has been changed to Interaction Changed Genes

   -  This better reflects the nature of gene changes due to neighboring
      cell interactions
   -  CPG functions are deprecated and will be removed in the future

-  Several function help pages have been updated with dummy example code

-  several small and big fixes to the code

Giotto 0.3.0
-----------------------

-  Default spatial network created with **createSpatialNetwork** is now
   a Delaunay spatial network.

.. code:: r

    createSpatialKNNnetwork(gobject)

    # or use this function with the following setting
    createSpatialNetwork(gobject, method = 'kNN')

-  The function names for extracting spatial genes have changed:

.. code:: r

===================================

How to contribute?
--------------------
We welcome contributions or suggestions from other developers. Below, we provide a number of rules, suggestions and tips to help you contribute to Giotto in a sustainable manner. Please contact us if you have questions or would like to discuss an addition or major modifications to the Giotto main code.

Coding Style
--------------------

Following a particular programming style will help programmers read and
understand source code conforming to the style, and help to avoid
introducing errors. Here we present a small list of guidelines on what
is considered a good practice when writing R codes in Giotto package.
Most of them are adapted from `Bioconductor - Coding
Style <https://bioconductor.org/developers/how-to/coding-style/>`__ or
`Google’s R Style
Guide <https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml>`__. These
guidelines are preferences and strongly encouraged!

-  **Indentation**

   -  Use 4 spaces for indenting. No tabs.
   -  Prefereably no lines longer than 80 characters. This includes
      function documentations, examples, and vignette code chunks.

-  **Function names**

   -  Use camelCase.
   -  Do not use “.” (in the S3 class system, some(x) where x is class A
      will dispatch to some.A).
   -  Use underscores for non-exported functions, like
      ‘non_exported_function’.

-  **Use of space**

   -  Do not place a space before a comma, but always place one after a
      comma. This: a, b, c.
   -  Always use space around “=” when using named arguments to
      functions. This: somefunc(a = 1, b = 2).



Stat Functions
------------------

Most Giotto commands can accept several matrix classes (SparseM, Matrix
or base). To facilitate this we provide small wrappers that work on any
type of matrix class.

-  **mean_giotto**: analogous to mean()
-  **rowSums_giotto**: analogous to rowSums()
-  **rowMeans_giotto**: analogous to rowMeans()
-  **colSums_giotto**: analogous to colSums()
-  **colMeans_giotto**: analogous to colMeans()
-  **t_giotto**: analogous to t()
-  **cor_sparse**: analogous to cor()



Auxiliary Functions
-------------------

Giotto has a number of auxiliary or convenience functions that might
help you to adapt your code or write new code for Giotto. We encourage
you to use these small functions to maintain uniformity throughout the
code.

-  **giotto_lapply**: analogous to lapply() and works for both windows
   and unix systems
-  **all_plots_save_function**: compatible with Giotto instructions and
   helps to automatically save generated plots
-  **determine_cores**: to determine the number of cores to use if a
   user does not set this explicitly
-  **get_os**: to identify the operating system
-  **package_check**: to check if a package exists, works for packages
   on CRAN, Bioconductor and Github.

The last function should be used within your contribution code. It has
the additional benefit that it will suggest the user how to download the
package if it is not available. To keep the size of Giotto within limits
we prefer not to add too many new dependencies.


Accessors
-------------------

Giotto stores information in different slots, which can be accessed
through these accessor functions.

-  **select_expression_values**: To select the expression matrix to use
   (raw, normalized, scaled or custom)
-  **select_dimReduction**: To select the dimension reduction values to
   use
-  **select_NearestNetwork**: To select the nearest neighbor network
   (kNN or sNN) to use
-  **select_spatialNetwork**: To select the spatial network to use
-  **select_spatialGrid**: To select the spatial grid to use


Python code
----------------------

To use Python code we prefer to create a python wrapper/functions around
the python code, which can then be sourced by reticulate. As an example
we show the basic principles of how we implemented the Leiden clustering
algorithm.

1. write python wrapper and store as python_leiden.py in */inst/python*:

.. code-block::
	
   import igraph as ig 
   import leidenalg as la
   import pandas as pd 
   import networkx as nx

   def python_leiden(df, partition_type, initial_membership=None, weights=None, n_iterations=2, seed=None, resolution_parameter = 1):

   # Create networkx object
   Gx = nx.from_pandas_edgelist(df = df, source = 'from', target =  'to', edge_attr = 'weight')  

   # Get weight attribute
   myweights = nx.get_edge_attributes(Gx, 'weight')

   ....

   return(leiden_dfr)



2. Source python code with reticulate:  

.. code-block::


   python_leiden_function = system.file("python", "python_leiden.py", package = 'Giotto')
   reticulate::source_python(file = python_leiden_function)


3. Use python code as if R code:

*See **doLeidenCLuster** for more detailed information* 

.. code-block::

 pyth_leid_result = python_leiden(df = network_edge_dt,
                                   partition_type = partition_type,
                                   initial_membership = init_membership,
                                   weights = 'weight',
                                   n_iterations = n_iterations,
                                   seed = seed_number,
                                   resolution_parameter = resolution)

Example
-----------------

As an example we show the implementation of SPARK, which is a recent
method developed by `Sun et
al <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-019-0701-7>`__ and provide some
comments within the code.

                 expression_values = 'raw',
                 num_core = 5,
                 covariates = NULL,
                 return_object = 'data.table',
