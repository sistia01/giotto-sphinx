Getting Started 
==========================================================

Description 
==============================================================

- Giotto provides a flexible framework for common single-cell processing steps such as:
   
  - Quality control
  - Normalization
  - Dimension reduction
  - Clustering and cell type annotation

* To facilitate the analysis of recently emerging high-throughput, but lower-resolution spatial transcriptomic technologies, such as 10X Genomics Visium and Slide-seq, Giotto has 3 implemented algorithms for estimating the spatial enrichment of different cell types by integration of known gene signatures or single-cell RNAseq expression and annotation data.
* Spatial information is retained through the formation of a spatial grid and/or a spatial proximity network, which is used to:
  
  * Identify spatial genes
  * Extract continuous spatial-expression patterns
  * Identify discrete spatial domains using HMRF
  * Explore cell-type/cell-type spatial interaction enrichment or depletion
  * Calculate spatially increased ligand-receptor expression in cells of interacting cell type pairs
  * Find interaction changed genes (ICG): genes that change expression in one cell type due to interaction with a neighboring cell type

* Giotto provides a number of options to visualize both 2D and 3D data and the outcome of Giotto can be interactively explored using `Giotto Viewer`_, which allows you to overlay the obtained results with raw or additional images of the profiled tissue section(s).

Make sure to check out the **Datasets** section to see examples of the Giotto workflow.


Requirements
=============================================================
* R (>= 3.5.1)
* Python (>= 3.0)
* `Windows, MacOS or Linux specific installation tools.`_

.. _Windows, MacOS or Linux specific installation tools.: https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200486498-Package-Development-Prerequisites



Installation
===================


R Installation 
------------------------------------------------------------
First Time R Package Installation 
------------------------------------------------------------
*Package Development Requirements*

If this is the first time you build and install an R package you can follow `this link <https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200486498-Package-Development-Prerequisites>`_, which has simple installation instructions for Windows, Mac OSX and Linux.

To specifically install the command-line tools of Xcode for Mac OSX you might also need to run this line **in terminal**:

.. code-block: 

  xcode-select -- install 


First Time Giotto Installation 
------------------------------------------------------------
You can install Giotto with (~1-5 mins)

.. code-block::

	library(devtools) # If not installed: install.packages('devtools')
	library(remotes)  #If not installed: install.packages('remotes')
	remotes::install_github("RubD/Giotto") 

	# Compilation (gfortran) problems? Check goftran.
	# This version does not require C compilation
	remotes::install_github("RubD/Giotto@cless") 

Required Python Modules
------------------------------------------------------------
These are necessary to run all available analyses, but can be installed automatically:

* pandas
* python-igraph (igraph)
* networkx
* leidenalg
* python-louvain (community)
* smfishHmrf
* python.app (**OSX only**)
* scikit-learn

Automatic installation
------------------------------------------------------------
The python modules will be installed automatically in a miniconda environment when installing Giotto. However, it will ask you whether you want to install them and you can opt out and select your preferred python path. In that case you need to do a manual installation of the python modules.


Python Manual installation
------------------------------------------------------------
**Install with pip in python3**

*For OSX, Windows, or Linux:* 

.. code-block:: 

	pip3 install pandas python-igraph networkx python-louvain leidenalg scikit-learn smfishHmrf


**Conda Install**

If pip install does not work, try installing them within a `conda environment <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-with-commands>`_. Something like this might work, see also this `link <https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/creating-python-virtual-environments-with-conda-why-and-how-180ebd02d1db>`_.

1. Create yaml file (e.g. environment.yml) with the following information:

.. code-block:: 

	name: giotto_env
	channels:
	  — defaults
	dependencies:
	 — pip=3.4
	 — pandas
	 — networkx
	 - python-igraph
	 - leidenalg
	 - python-louvain
	 - python.app (!!only for OSX!!)
	 - scikit-learn
	prefix: /Users/your_username/anaconda3/envs/giotto_env

2. Create Conda Environment Based on yaml File: 

.. code-block:: 

	conda env create -f environment.yml

  
3. Use the path to this environment when you create the Giotto instructions or Giotto object


*For OSX:*

.. code-block::

	/Users/your_username/anaconda3/envs/giotto_env/bin/pythonw


*For Linux:*

.. code-block::
	
	/Users/your_username/anaconda3/envs/giotto_env/bin/python


*For Windows:*

.. code-block:: 

	/Users/your_username/anaconda3/envs/giotto_env/python.exe
