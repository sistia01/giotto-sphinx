Working with the Giotto class: *How to create Giotto object with precomputed results?*
================================================================================================


1. The Giotto Class
===================
A Giotto object or gobject can be created with **createGiottoObject** or **createGiottoVisiumObject** for Visium datasets.

.. code-block::
    
    gobject = createGiottoObject()

    gvisiumobject = createGiottoVisiumObject()


**createGiottoVisiumObject** expects a typical Visium 10X data folder structure or a path to the h5 file, but **createGiottoObject** is more flexible and can also accept precomputed results (e.g. PCA, UMAP, network, …)


2. Giotto Slots 
================
2.1 Required Slots
-------------------
The minimum requirements to make a Giotto class object are:

* Raw_exprs: matrix with raw expression values
* Spatial_locs: spatial coordinates for the cell (or spot) centroids. If this is not provided it will actually create dummy coordinates.

2.2 Additional Matrix Slots
----------------------------

* **norm_expr**: slot to keep matrix with normalized expression values
    * Use expression_values = ‘normalized’ to access this slot in downstream functions
* **norm_scaled_expr**: slot to keep matrix with normalized and scaled expression values
    * Use expression_values = ‘scaled’ to access this slot in downstream functions
* **custom_expr**: slot to keep matrix with custom values
    * Use expression_values = ‘custom’ to access this slot in downstream functions
